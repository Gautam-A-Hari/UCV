1 ok to use each ens as separate field
2 ok to call filter
3 still faild to build paraview with self selected field regions [ok]
4 after extraction, the data set become the unstructured grid, need to support that in filter, we can use resample to image as a temporary solution, but resample does not work well for screwed data set, asked on paraview discources
5 compute the no ens solutions and set it for whole data set properties
(output should be entropy or probability?)
start to record some results
make sure workflow
raw data -> add ens -> extract encertainty property / no ens for each value -> property/similariteis between them (k means, cluster ML based approach)
